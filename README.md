# SpringMath

The file that is the format I want to do is the randomMathBackend.html.
It includes multiple Ajax calls, so I do not need to refresh the page to
get results. Also, all the variables are handled in the backend to avoid any
tamper with the variables from the browser.

When you test, you have to go to localhost:8080/math and you will see that
page. Look into BasicMathController.java for more precisions on the type of
requests that are accepted.

I used STS Spring for this project. Just copy-paste all the files in a STS
project and it will work just fine. Put the content of the src folder inside 
the generated folder by STS with the same name.
