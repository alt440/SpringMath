<title>Notes for variable timed exam</title>

To have a variable that allows users to select the time they want to get the answer, I had to use thymeleaf and redirects.

Here is the method added in the basic math controller:
@GetMapping("/jumpToDestination")
	public String jumpToDestination(RedirectAttributes redirect) {
		//redirecting to another controller with the time value
		redirect.addFlashAttribute("time", timeBetweenEquations);
		switch(destination) {
		case 0: return "redirect:/addition/timed";
		case 1: return "redirect:/subtraction/timed";
		case 2: return "redirect:/multiplication/timed";
		case 3: return "redirect:/division/timed";
		default: return "redirect:/addition/timed";
		}
	}

So no matter what page I am redirecting to, the variable time will be sent as well. I used a flash attribute to send the object.
Notice also that there is a redirect: before the URL is put. This is because this links goes to another page right after and I needed to send the value.
	
Cant use static variables because there is 1 unique copy, which would make users be able to see someone else's score I believe.
Here is the method in some operation controller:
@GetMapping("/timed")
	    public String examTimed(@ModelAttribute("time") int time, Model model) {
	    	//gets the time value from the basic math controller /selectTime
	    	model.addAttribute("timeVal", time);
	    	return "randomMathDivisionExamTimed";
	    }

So here in this second method I am getting the time value from the previous method. The model object is initially not containing any object.
I add the time value to the model before sending it to the frontend.
Note that this method will make the page /timed not able to show without the model attribute time. Java Spring will show an error in that case.

Now in the frontend, I got the value with thymeleaf.
<!-- th:inline allows thymeleaf to recognize this is javascript -->
	<script th:inline="text">

Have to put th:inline argument for thymeleaf to recognize the method of showing data.
//thymeleaf instructions
[# th:if="${timeVal != 0 && timeVal != null}"]
	timeRemaining = [[${timeVal}]];
[/]
This above is an if condition for the timeVal. If the timeVal value is null or 0, then keep the default value (which is 6, because I have set it before the if condition to 6.)
