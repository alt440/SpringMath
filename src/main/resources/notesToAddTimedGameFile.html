<title>How to create the timed game</title>

First, you have to set two new get mapping to your controller.
Here they are:
@GetMapping("/timed")
public String examTimed() {
	return "randomMathAdditionExamTimed";
}

@GetMapping("/done")
@ResponseBody
public String sendResults() {
	BasicMathController.setCorrectAnswers(correctAnswers);
	BasicMathController.setTotalAnswers(totalAnswers);
	return "OK";
}

You will need to change the return answer of examTimed() as it depends on the name of your file.
The sendResults() method sends the result to the BasicMathController file. This file will get
those values and will show its own /done URL based on those values (eventually).

Then, you have to add this to your html inside the scoreHandling div:
<br/>
<br/>
<div id="circleFillUp">
	<div class='outer-shadow'>
	</div>
	<div class='inner-shadow'>
	</div>
	<div class='hold left' id="leftPart">
		<div class='fill' id="fillOne"></div>
	</div>
	<div class='hold right' id="rightPart">
	    <div class='fill' id="fillTwo"></div>
	</div>
</div>

This above is the structure of the circle animation that fills up. All the code to do the circle animation is in the randomMath.css file.

Then, some stuff needs to be added to the script:
//this is a lock that allows only one event at a time to enter submit button
var lock = false;

//trigger focus on input when going on page
$("#answerText").focus();

//to press submit on enter
$("#answerText").keyup(function(event){
	if (event.which === 13){					
		$("#submitAnswer").click();
	} 
});

//clicks on submit answer when time is up (when right animation has finished)
$('.right').on('animationend webkitAnimationEnd', function() { 
    $("#submitAnswer").click();
});

This needs to be added as the first lines of code after the init of jQuery ( $(document).ready(function(){}))
The lock is because I did not want both the animation and the user to press submit, thus giving two points instead of 1.

The focus() line is simply to give focus on the input so the user does not lose any time selecting the input.
The keyup function is to send the user input once the user presses enter.

The next event for .right is because the circleFillUp animation contains two animations: the left and right. The right animation 
is the last one to get executed. This is why when the right animation ends (this is the event captured), the system triggers a click on submit.

Then you need to add this as the first line of the click function of the submitAnswer click event:
//pause the animations
$(".left").css("-webkit-animation-play-state", "paused");
$(".right").css("-webkit-animation-play-state", "paused");
				
if(lock === false){
	lock = true;
	//... the rest of the code
}

This pauses the two animations, and checks if the lock is in use. There is no "else" condition: everything contained within the submitAnswer click event goes in the if(lock === false)
condition.
