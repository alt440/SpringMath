To add other pages of math, you must:
create a new controller (add the request mapping on top)
Change the operator of that new controller
Create a new html page
Create a folder in your resources mapping to the request mapping folder
Recreate all the content you had in the general folder into that new folder
When that is done, rectify the AJAX calls.

What is missing:
-Visual explanation of how math works --> ball explanation missing for subtraction, multiplication, division; visual scenario only
missing for division. --> Visual scenario division DONE! Should review all of the visual scenarios though.
-->Ball explanation will go in a different page because it seems to be too much on a single page. It will go on pages that explain the operations.
Thus, ball explanation for each operation needed. Do it on different page. TO BE DONE
-Home page --> DONE!
-Login? NO
-Statistics? NO (Would require login)
-When game becomes too easy, give suggestions to go further? --> Magic squares, exam timed (--> DONE!)
--> could put math ads on this page, seems appropriate.
-Vocabulary page: Explaining the terms I use in the practice pages
-Internationalization: Translate website into French (DONE!)
-Make website mobile friendly --> in process (Pretty much done)
-Complete the "done" page --> DONE
-Web tracking page: Shows how many visitors from different countries across globe


Cool animation backgrounds: to fill void of equations pages

I am thinking about adding an animation where numbers fall from the top of the page.
--> Using blender? (instead I did a static page with numbers in the background and an animation with numbers entering a black hole)

This is where I changed an image color from green to blue: https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/replace-color-result.php very good
This is how I removed the background color from my operator images: https://appuals.com/ms-paint-turn-white-background-transparent/
